Trained ResNet50 deep architecture with bird image dataset with 200 species of bird. Created a website using Flask for UI and Backend management.
User can upload any bird image and can get the name of the bird.

Since the model is quite robust and well trained but the dataset I chose has only 200 species, that is quite small compared to all the species.
